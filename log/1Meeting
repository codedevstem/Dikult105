1: Did
  -Find an idea that we all like and is doable during the course.
    -Settled on two ideas:
      1 - A portrait/featuring page for famous web designers.
      2 - A website featuring different places/destinations.
    -We opted to go for idea 1.
    -For this idea we wanted to write about web designers that have
    been influential and important for creating the Internet today
    from a web-design perspective.
2: To-do
  -Nothing.
